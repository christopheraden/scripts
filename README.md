Christopher Aden's sometimes useful scripts
=======
A place I dump files I want people to see. I do not claim these to be creative or efficient, but it is nice to be able to run a script to do something instead of type it out every single time.

*Decrapify:* I hate how LaTeX clutters up my project directory with index files, toc files, etc. Decrapify deletes all the compilation files with one click. Just use chmod +x decrapify.sh to make it executable, double click it, and it'll kill those pesky files. Neat freaks, rejoice.

*Font Change:* A LaTeX project I'm doing uses a proprietary style file. Changing the behavior of the enumerate environment did not work for me. This unfortunate hack is the result of a bad template. For similar examples of mis-matched solutions, see the following: ![alt text](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/137/f/6/my_spoon_is_too_big_by_duplamon-d3gk9fq.jpg "This is not the right tool for the job")

For people on Windows--use Cygwin. It would take a matter of minutes to draft something up in PowerShell, but honestly, who would want to?
